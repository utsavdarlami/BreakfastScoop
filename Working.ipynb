       "<content:encoded>An Ohio doctor was charged with murder Wednesday in the deaths of 25 hospital patients who, authorities say, were killed with deliberate overdoses of painkillers, many of them administered by other medical workers on his orders.\n",
       "<p>In one of the biggest cases of its kind ever brought against an American health care professional, William Husel was accused of ordering outsize doses of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. Many of the patients who died were on ventilators and receiving palliative care. The deaths occurred between 2015 and 2018.</p>\n",
       "<p>Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O’Brien compared Husel’s actions to extinguishing a dwindling candle.</p>\n",
       "<p>“That candle, while there may be just a half an inch of wax left, if I blow that candle out, I’m causing that flame to go out sooner than it would naturally,” O’Brien said.</p>\n",
       "<p>Husel, 43, pleaded not guilty after turning himself in earlier in the day. A judge set bail at $1 million.</p>\n",
       "<p>The doctor is the lone defendant. Authorities are not prosecuting nurses, pharmacists and others involved in the deaths, though dozens of hospital employees have been reported to professional boards for investigation and potential disciplinary action.</p>\n",
       "<p>Husel’s lawyer said he was trying to provide “comfort care” for dying patients.</p>\n",
       "<p>“At no time did Dr. Husel ever intend to euthanize anyone — euthanize meaning speed up death,” defense attorney Richard Blake said.</p>\n",
       "<p>The patients were going to die whether they were being treated by Husel or another physician, Blake said.</p>\n",
       "<p>The Columbus-area Mount Carmel Health System has publicly apologized. It issued a statement Wednesday pledging to continue cooperating with authorities and making “meaningful changes” to ensure such events never happen again.</p>\n",
       "<p>The system found that Husel ordered potentially fatal drug doses for 29 patients, including five who might have received those drugs when there still was a chance to improve their conditions with treatment. The hospital system said six more patients got doses that were excessive but probably did not cause their deaths.</p>\n",
       "<p>The murder charges were brought only in cases that involved fentanyl doses of at least 500 micrograms. The prosecutor said the investigation remains open and other cases are still under review.</p>\n",
       "<p>Husel was fired in December and stripped of his medical license after concerns about his orders were brought to the attention of officials at Mount Carmel, where he had worked for five years.</p>\n",
       "<p>Mount Carmel has said it should have investigated and taken action sooner. It has acknowledged that the doctor was not removed from patient care for four weeks after the concerns were raised, and three patients died during that time.</p>\n",
       "<p>Police Sgt. Terry McConnell said none of the families who talked with investigators believed that what happened was “mercy treatment.”</p>\n",
       "<p>Amy Pfaff, whose mother was among the patients whose deaths prompted the charges, said she still wonders about his motives.</p>\n",
       "<p>“Trust me, I sit many hours sitting trying to figure out why would he do this to so many people, and I just don’t know,” Pfaff said.</p>\n",
       "<p>More than two dozen wrongful-death lawsuits have been filed against the doctor and the hospital system, including one by Pfaff over the October 2017 death of her mother, Beverlee Schirtzinger.</p>\n",
       "<p>The hospital system settled some of the cases for hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>\n",
       "<p>All employees who had a role in administering medication to the victims have been removed from patient care as a precaution, hospital officials have said.</p>\n",
       "<p>All told, 48 nurses and pharmacists <a href=\"https://apnews.com/ab3a02dffb17476eaebb17d2c2ad3dd4\">were reported</a> to their respective professional boards. Thirty of those employees were put on leave, and 18 no longer work there, including some who left years ago, officials said.</p>\n",
       "<p>Records show no prior disciplinary action against Husel by the Ohio State Medical Board. The board will not disclose whether it received any complaints that did not result in action.</p>\n",
       "<p>The allegations against Husel recalled another Ohio case involving a former nurse’s aide dubbed the Angel of Death. That man, Donald Harvey, confessed in 1987 to killing 37 people, most of them hospital patients, over the span of two decades in Ohio and Kentucky. He was given multiple life sentences and died in 2017 after being attacked by a fellow inmate.</p>\n",

       "<content:encoded>China has restricted entry of locals from Humla after murder of a Chinese woman.<br/>\n",
       "Tirtha Khadera of Sarkideu in Sarkegad rural municipality was arrested in Taklakot of Tibet where he had gone to work on charge of murdering a Chinese woman in the third week of May, according to Assistant Chief District Officer (CDO) of Humla Mahesh Kumar Pokharel.<br/>\n",
       "Chinese police started to send back Nepali workers going to Taklakot for work after that.<br/>\n",
       "“We have arrested him after he murdered a woman going to bank by hitting her with a rod. We are taking him to Lhasa for additional investigation,” Pokharel quoted the Chinese authorities as saying after Khadera’s arrest. “They had not talked about sending other workers back. But they started to send back Nepali workers from the next day,” he told Setopati.<br/>\n",
       "He revealed that almost 500 Nepali workers have been sent back in three weeks.<br/>\n",
       "Nepal-China treaty allows citizens of both the countries to travel up to 30 kilometers inside the other country by producing a pass. Nepalis in Humla go to Taklakot to work and for business using the facility.<br/>\n",
       "There are jobs in Taklakot during the season of Mansarovar pilgrimage from May till September. Around 5,000-7,000 Nepalis go to Taklakot during the season every year to work in construction projects, hotels and for other works.<br/>\n",
       "“It is a good source of income as one could earn up to Rs 5,000 a day for such seasonal works. But there is problem this year,” Pokharel stated. “We had informed the Foreign Ministry through the Home Ministry after the Chinese side started to send Nepali workers back. They have not sent back Nepali workers n the past two days apparently after diplomatic initiative.<br/>\n",
       "Locals in Taklakot have been warning they will not allow Nepalis to work from now onward even though the authorities have stopped sending the workers back.<br/>\n",
       "“W e do not have additional information about Khadera. We have proposed to hold a border meeting. The meeting will be convened by June end. We will put our concerns during the meeting,” Pokharel added.<br/>\n",
       "Secretary at the Foreign Ministry Shankar Das Bairagi, meanwhile, has said the government is taking diplomatic initiative to resolve the problems seen in Taklakot.\n",

       "<content:encoded>Nepali Congress (NC) has opposed distribution of medals to members of the first and second Constituent Assembly (CA) by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.<br/>\n",
       "“The style of distribution of identifying medals to those who made the Constitution is like thanking them. We don’t like that,” NC lawmaker Minendra Rijal said during the zero hour in the House of Representatives (HoR) on Wednesday. “There are talks that the artistic display of lines carved to support the Constitution in the medal have given other kind of message about Constitution promulgation and ownership on top of that.”<br/>\n",
       "“There are public grievances that the style of handing it and the design of medal have not been able to imbibe the spirit of the struggle filled with sacrifices and succession. I want to draw the attention of everyone concerned,” he stated.<br/>\n",
       "Rijal has yet to receive his medal. “Medals should not have been distributed in a way to thank for formulating Constitution. I don’t even like the medal’s design. The symbol of sun is there,” he listed the reasons for not receiving the medal.<br/>\n",
       "“I have heard that Rs 175,000 has been spent on one medal. Why should we distribute medals by spending so much from the state coffers?” he added. “The symbol of sun is kept in a way it is clearly visible. Can a single party monopolize the Constitution? Act as if it solely formulated the Constitution.”<br/>\n",
       "Sun is the election symbol of ruling CPN.<br/>\n",
       "“I have already briefed NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba about this. The party should discuss about the medal and take decision. If somebody has received, it should be returned,” he stressed.<br/>\n",
       "“BP (Koirala) did not receive any medal during his lifetime. Girija Prasad Koirala also did not receive when he was alive. Should we followers of BP receive medals?” he asked.<br/>\n",
       "He also opined that the handing out of medals is not in accordance to the spirit of republicanism. “Handing out medals is residue of feudal attitude. I did not like the style in which president handed over the medals.”<br/>\n",
       "NC lawmaker Gagan Thapa also has not received the medal. “We are people’s representatives. Should we attend parties by donning that medal? Our mindset is not republican. The people will respect us for promulgating the Constitution in itself. The CA gave us CA members logo. That suffices,” Thapa stated.<br/>\n",
       "Joint Secretary in the internal management division of the Home Ministry, that designed the medals, Mahadev Panta, however, said there is no sun in the medal. “There are 77 stars in the outermost circle. That depict 77 districts. There are seven rhododendrons inside which depict seven provinces,” he elaborated. “The straight lines are local bodies. They depict 753 local bodies.”<br/>\n",
       "He claimed that the lines that look like sun do not make a sun. “The lines that depict local bodies are golden. That means the future of local bodies is bright. That is not sun.”\n",

       "<content:encoded>Mount Everest and its surrounding peaks are increasingly polluted and warmer, and nearby glaciers are melting at an alarming rate that is likely to make it more dangerous for future climbers, a U.S. scientist who spent weeks in the Everest region said Tuesday.\n",
       "<p>Professor John All of Western Washington University said after returning from the mountains that he and his team of fellow scientists found there was lot of pollution buried deep in the snow, and that the snow was surprisingly dark when they processed and filtered it.</p>\n",
       "<p>“What that means is there are little pieces of pollution that the snow is forming around, so the snow is actually trapping the pollution and pulling it down,” All said in Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital.</p>\n",
       "<p>All and his team spent weeks testing snow on Everest and its surrounding peaks, as well as plants on the foothills.</p>\n",
       "<p>“The warming temperature is melting the glaciers and the snow around Mount Everest very quickly, so what happens is even when there is a storm it melts in a couple of hours,” he said. “The glaciers are retreating dramatically because of global warming.”</p>\n",
       "<p>He said because the glaciers are getting thinner and smaller, it is making it more dangerous for climbers.</p>\n",
       "<p>The team had been planning to climb both Everest and sister peak Lhotse, but crowding on Everest forced them to change their plans. They climbed up to the last camp at 8,000 meters (26,240 feet), the last point the two mountains share, and only reached the top of Lhotse.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hundreds of climbers had lined up on May 22 and 23 to attempt to reach Everest’s summit, creating a traffic jam that is being blamed for the deaths of several climbers.</p>\n",
       "<p>All said it was too risky for his team to collect samples with that many climbers moving very slowly.</p>\n",
       "<p>The scientists said the samples and data would be processed once they return to United States, and they would then issue a report on their findings. They had done similar research in the area in 2009.</p>\n",
       "<p>“Overall, the past 10 years have seen a lot changes in the mountains, and they all have been for the negative environmentally in terms of long term survivability of the glaciers,” All said.</p>\n",

Different advocates pleaded on behalf of Ncell on Tuesday. The full bench has decided to conduct the next hearing three weeks to the day on June 25.<br/>\n",
       "A joint bench of Justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Prakash Kumar Dhungana on May 7 had ordered the Large Taxpayers Office to not immediately recover the capital gain tax from Ncell and called for convening of a full bench to decide on the petition.<br/>\n",
       "A single bench of Justice Bam Kumar Shrestha hearing the petition on April 25 had issued a show cause notice in the name of the office to explain the reason for determining the tax amount and stopped immediate recovery of tax.<br/>\n",
       "Ncell had filed the petition against the tax determination a day before meeting the seven-day deadline issued by the Large Taxpayers Office to pay the capital gain tax.<br/>\n",
       "The Taxpayers Office on April 16 had determined that Ncell should pay Rs 39.06 billion more in capital gain tax. It had sent a notice to Ncell to pay the tax within seven days. Ncell, that has already deposited Rs 23.57 billion in two installments, has claimed that it should pay only Rs 14.365 billion more.<br/>\n",
       "It had pointed that the SC has just ordered to recover capital gain tax, and not interest and late fine. It added that it should pay 25 percent of the capital gain of Rs 143.65 billion during the sale which comes out at Rs 35.91 billion. It has contended that it, therefore, should pay only Rs 14.365 billion more as it has already deposited Rs 23.57 billion.<br/>\n",
       "Swedish-Finnish company TeliaSonera has not paid capital gain tax for sale of its 80% stake in Ncell to Malaysian company Axiata in April 2015. The Large Taxpayers Office earlier had determined that TeliaSonera had made capital gain of Rs 143.65 billion during the sale.<br/>\n",
       "The extended full bench of Supreme Court (SC) headed by Cholendra Shumsher Rana on February 6 had ordered that the capital gain tax be recovered from Ncell and Axiata.<br/>\n",
       "The Large Taxpayers Office issuing a notice on Tuesday had determined that Ncell must pay Rs 62.63 billion in capital gain tax including interest until now. It had told Ncell to pay the remaining Rs 39.06 billion within seven days.<br/>\n",
       "The full bench including Justices Meera Khadka, Bishwambhar Shrestha, Ananda Mohan Bhattarai and Tanka Moktan hearing a petition filed by Dwarika Nath Dhungel demanding the capital gain tax be recovered from Ncell on February 6 had issued a mandamus ruling that Ncell and Axiata should pay the tax.<br/>\n",
       "The mandamus reasoned that Ncell has to pay capital gain tax to the Nepal government despite TeliaSonera selling the shares to Axiata as its business is based in Nepal.<br/>\n",
       "The full judgement of the mandamus published on April 9 had ordered the government to recover the tax from the telecommunication company and its majority shareholder Axiata within three months.<br/>\n",
       "Malaysian company Axiata had bought Reynolds Holding, which held a majority stake in Ncell, from the Swedish-Finnish company TeliaSonera in April 2016. Reynolds Holding was TeliaSonera’s wholly-owned subsidiary, registered at Saint Kitts and Nevis, a tax haven.<br/>\n",
       "Though capital gains tax needs to be paid by the company that gains from the deal, TeliaSonera has already exited Nepal.<br/>\n",
       "Ncell has already deposited Rs 23.57 billion in two installments as tax applicable on the profit generated through sale of the telecom company. It had first paid Rs 9.97 billion in May, 2016 in tax return based on its own calculations. It had then paid Rs 13.60 billion on June 4, 2017 bowing to intense pressure and criticisms from a cross section of the society.\n",

       "<content:encoded>Nepali Congress (NC) lawmaker Gagan Thapa has said the government has defamed the parliament by providing Rs 60 million to the lawmakers.\n",
       "<p>Speaking during the discussion on the recent budget in the House of Representatives (HoR) on Tuesday, he complained that the government has given Rs 60 million to the lawmakers ignoring policy issues and told them to go to their respective constituencies taking the money.</p>\n",
       "<p>“I am a directly elected lawmaker. I also know that we should be connected to the demand for development. I also want to be connected,” he added. “The budget talks about Melamchi project, constructing tunnel way to connect with the capital, encroached land, green urbanization, cycle city and other issues. These issues are related to my constituency. I want to be connected on that. I raise questions about how we can be connected but don’t get answers. I present proposals in the parliament but they are not discussed.”</p>\n",
       "<p>He slammed the government for ignoring elected lawmakers on the issues of development related to their respective constituencies and providing Rs 60 million to be spent by directly elected lawmakers to silence them.</p>\n",
       "<p>“The government keeps me apart from all these things and tells me ‘honorable lawmaker you have received Rs 60 million. Go to your constituency and build the walls of temples, community buildings, buildings for grieving persons. Get connected to the people’,” he pointed. “We don’t want Rs 60 million to be connected with the people but want to connect with policies worth Rs 6 billion and even Rs 600 billion related to our places. We want to be connected with plans.</p>\n",
       "<p>“And the parliament cannot be defamed by telling us to go away with Rs 60 million,” he stated.</p>\n",
       "<p>He claimed that the prime minister and even speaker have selected projects of their constituencies in the budget.</p>\n",
       "<p>He criticized the budget saying it is such abysmal as the ruling CPN does not have any principle. He claimed that the budget has ignored the past studies and it does not give the feel of a stable government. “I want to ask finance minister, should I be happy about the budget as a lawmaker or sad as a citizen? I am confused.”</p>\n",
       "<p>He fired a riposte at CPN General Secretary Bishnu Paudel who on Monday had challenged the main opposition NC to oppose the hike in elderly allowance.<br/>\n",
       "The budget presented on May 29 has raised elderly allowance to Rs 3,000 a month from Rs 2,000.<br/>\n",
       "“A powerful lawmaker who can shake the foundation of Baluwatar stood here and challenged if anyone has the courage to speak about elderly allowance. I have the courage,” Thapa riposted during the HoR meeting on Tuesday.<br/>\n",
       "Thapa reminded that he opposed the decision of the government of his party president Sher Bahadur Deuba to bring down the eligibility for elderly allowance to 65 years and raise it to Rs 5,000 a month in the past.<br/>\n",
       "“I did not just opposed the decision of the then outgoing Deuba government to bring down the eligibility for elderly allowance to 65 years and raise it to Rs 5,000 a month saying it cannot be raised on whims. I am a lawmaker who filed an amendment proposal saying the base year should be made 70 years when the law was drafted,” Thapa stated.<br/>\n",
       "“There are so many social security programs. They need to be integrated and rationalized, and there should be differentiation about which should be made universal, which targeted, and which connected to production. The biggest issue is social security is not just cash transfer. Is it not appropriate to discuss to provide facilities worth Rs 30,000 and not just Rs 3,000 through non-cash provisions?” he questioned.</p>\n",
