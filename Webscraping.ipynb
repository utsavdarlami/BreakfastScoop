       "&lt;p&gt;The NIC, in its recommendation, has asked the authorities concerned to come up with necessary policy and legal framework for dignifying the life of needy people, through empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;Local levels have also been asked to discourage farmers from using pesticides in agriculture, by setting up a mechanism to regulate agro-farming.

       "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new study shoots down the notion that medical marijuana laws can prevent opioid overdose deaths, challenging a favourite talking point of legal pot advocates.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Researchers repeated an analysis that sparked excitement years ago. The previous work linked medical marijuana laws to slower than expected increases in state prescription opioid death rates from 1999 to 2010. The original authors speculated patients might be substituting marijuana for painkillers, but they warned against drawing conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Still, states ravaged by painkiller overdose deaths began to rethink marijuana, leading several to legalize pot for medical use.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;When the new researchers included data through 2017, they found the reverse: States passing medical marijuana laws saw a 23% higher than expected rate of deaths involving prescription opioids.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Legalizing medical marijuana &amp;#8220;is not going to be a solution to the opioid overdose crisis,&amp;#8221; said Chelsea Shover of Stanford University School of Medicine. &amp;#8220;It would be wonderful if that were true, but the evidence doesn&amp;#8217;t suggest that it is.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Shover and colleagues reported the findings Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It&amp;#8217;s unlikely, they said, that medical marijuana laws caused first one big effect and then the opposite. Any beneficial link was likely coincidental all along.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s reasonable to say it was saving lives before but it&amp;#8217;s killing people now,&amp;#8221; Shover said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;In the opioid crisis, dozens of forces are playing out across the nation in different ways. How widely available is the overdose antidote naloxone? Who has insurance? How broadly does insurance cover addiction treatment?&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s more, prescription pills once were involved in the largest share of overdose deaths, but that changed as heroin and then fentanyl surged. The studies on marijuana laws and opioid deaths don&amp;#8217;t account for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The new study undermines recent policy changes in some states. Last week, New Mexico joined New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in approving marijuana for patients with opioid addiction.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was told my paper helped change the law in New York. I was appalled,&amp;#8221; said Rosalie Liccardo Pacula of the Rand Drug Policy Research Center. She co-authored a 2018 study on marijuana laws and overdose deaths.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Experts agree evidence doesn&amp;#8217;t support marijuana as a treatment for opioid addiction. Drugs like buprenorphine, morphine and naltrexone should be used instead, Pacula said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Authors of the original research welcomed the new analysis.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We weren&amp;#8217;t happy when a billboard went up saying marijuana laws reduce overdose deaths,&amp;#8221; said Brendan Saloner of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. &amp;#8220;That was very hard for us to rein in.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Marijuana has been shown to help ease chronic pain, and other studies have suggested medical marijuana laws may reduce opioid prescribing. So there&amp;#8217;s still reason to believe that for some people, marijuana can substitute for opioids as a pain reliever.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;As for addiction and the overdose crisis, &amp;#8220;we should focus our research and policies on other questions that might make a difference,&amp;#8221; Shover said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nepal’s economy is projected to grow at 6.8 per cent (at basic prices) in the current fiscal year. This is the third consecutive year the country’s economy is expanding at a rate of above six per cent. This is a feat for an economy which has witnessed average annual growth rate of four per cent for 45 years from 1970 to 2014. As Nepal is on the cusp of escaping the low-growth trap, there are concerns about quality of economic growth, as the contribution of the industrial sector — known as the largest job creator — to the gross domestic product has dipped to 14.6 per cent from 16.9 per cent in fiscal year 2000-01. On the other hand, services sector’s contribution to economic output has jumped to 57.8 per cent. But most of the jobs in the services sector are being created in wholesale and retail trade, which are low-paying, whereas employment opportunities in high-value services sector are very limited. &lt;span style=\"color: #ff6600\"&gt;Rupak D Sharma&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;The Himalayan Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; met &lt;span style=\"color: #ff6600\"&gt;Hans Timmer&lt;/span&gt;, chief economist, South Asia Region, the World Bank, to discuss these issues.

       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nepal has achieved growth rate of over six per cent for three consecutive years. But growth is mainly driven by low-productivity services. How do you assess this situation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;High growth rates are a positive sign and they might continue for some time in Nepal given the presence of a stable government and focus on investment. But the big concern is that Nepal’s growth has been mainly driven by domestic demand and not exports. This has widened current account and fiscal deficits. Nepal is financing current account deficit by dipping into foreign exchange reserves, which is not sustainable. So, it needs to enhance exports. But it is not only Nepal that is underperforming in exports in South Asia. South Asia is exporting only a third of what it should be, compared to countries with similar characteristics. Nepal’s situation is even worse. It is exporting only a ninth of what it should be, given its characteristics. That really is a long-term concern because I don’t know a single country that has been growing decades after decades at high rates just from domestic demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exports cannot jump without a medium- to long-term plan. Since Nepal does not have a comprehensive plan, will it face problems in even sustaining six per cent growth in the coming years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Nepal does not need a long time to start boosting exports. Export level is so low at the moment, there is a lot of unutilised capacity. Of course, Nepal cannot solve all the structural problems at the moment, but I think it is incredibly urgent to understand factors that are restricting export and take appropriate measures to generate quick results. Take the case of agricultural products. Today, there are technologies that can improve productivity and enable farmers to gain access to international markets. So, there is no reason to think that you cannot enhance exports of agricultural products within a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could you give examples of countries that have been able to rapidly increase agricultural exports within a short period of time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;One country that has made impressive reforms in the last two years is Uzbekistan. It once had a centralised top-down economy. But the new president started making reforms. Uzbekistan could have said the problems were very difficult and that it would take decades to make changes. But they focused on exports and short-term results and they saw that opportunity in agriculture, especially horticulture. The success partly came from reforms in exchange rate and trade policies. But the government also made it clear that it was serious about solving problems of smaller farmers to boost exports because there was monopoly of intermediaries. So, results can come much earlier if you focus on right issues. Maybe, in Nepal, the focus on exports is not that strong.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with Nepal is that it is exporting agricultural products in raw form without adding much value. It appears this will continue for some time, as forward linkages are not being created. What is your take on this issue?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;In general, there are problems with exports in Nepal. This is partly because of remittances, which has made Nepal expensive and eroded competitiveness within the country. That explains why you cannot jump to a very high level of exports. There are also vested interests in Nepal, where companies have become accustomed to protection and they find it very difficult to see more competition. So, these are all structural problems. But this doesn’t mean you cannot have some success in the next two years or so. There are always low-hanging fruits. So, the country needs to say there is only one thing that it really needs to do now and that is start exporting. Nepal cannot continue to attain high growth rates in the long run without further integrating into the global market because that is where you get competitive pressure and knowledge. That means your investments and policies should be focused on raising exports. Nepal must understand that composition of growth is really essential to make the growth sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The government has identified a number of exportable goods and services where Nepal has competitive and comparative edge. But their production is low. Also, Nepal often fails to come up with home-grown solutions and tends to replicate foreign policies, which do not guarantee results. Is that a problem?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting concepts in economics is comparative advantage. You can be bad in everything and you can still have comparative advantage to export. Nepal should identify those areas. Secondly, the problem is not only about scaling up. To scale up, you have to start somewhere. And Nepal hasn’t started in many areas. So, Nepal needs to start talking to smaller farmers and companies and students who have graduated from universities and see if they can actually supply products, however small, to the international market. Nepal should also open itself to foreign investors because foreign direct investment is non-existent here. Foreigners, who see opportunities to invest here, can add higher value and push up exports. Nepal must understand that development is not possible without exports.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you mean to say there is a problem with planning and Nepal does not have the will as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;There is not enough of relentless focus on exports. That focus is lacking in the government, the private sector, students graduating from universities and everybody in the society. The real opportunities are in the international market and with new digital technologies, landlocked countries like Nepal can benefit a lot. In the beginning, it could be at a smaller scale, but that’s not a problem; let it be small, but then it will start growing.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But things are not likely to change much in the coming days because the country is too dependent on low-productivity services, like wholesale and retail trade. Does this scenario make you optimistic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;I would be a lot more optimistic here. I was recently in Pakistan where I also met representatives of the private sector. They all said that they wanted to export more, but at the same time they were advocating for higher import tariffs because they saw that as the only solution for current account and fiscal deficits. They said higher tariffs would provide them competitive edge and protect jobs in the country. You can never export more with that attitude, because low import also means low exports. That kind of attitude will also prevent a country from moving towards a more competitive environment. So, I see that as a wrong focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You just said low import translates into low exports. Nepal’s imports are lately increasing, partly because of imports of capital goods. But Nepal’s failure to enhance exports has started exerting pressure on foreign exchange reserves, generating calls from the International Monetary Fund to cool down growth. Is Nepal’s economy overheating? And how can Nepal strike a balance because without rapid growth it cannot escape low-income trap?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;I understand IMF’s analysis because when there is large current account deficit, despite inflow of all the remittances, you say growth is more demand-driven than supply-driven. That, to some extent, is the definition of overheating. In my view, you shouldn’t solve this problem by importing less. As you said, those imports are necessary, either to increase productivity or enhance capacity of sectors. So, it would be self-defeating to say Nepal should import less. Nepal can sustain larger current account deficit for one or two years if the purpose is to increase productivity and lift exports. But if Nepal continues to import to drive domestic demand, I would be completely on the IMF’s side because that would be unsustainable and can create problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nepal’s failure to drive up exports is also the result of lethargy expressed by the government to promote the private sector, isn’t it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;You cannot just blame the government for lack of exports. The problem is also in the private sector. The government cannot export. It can take away impediments and build infrastructure. It is ultimately the private sector that should drive exports. So, export promotion should be a subject of public discourse than just a government-led programme. The problem is that the private sector is inward-looking, more interested in defending its own interests, and pretty happy being isolated because it can get rents out of the situation. That mentality has to change.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the private sector of most of the developed Asian economies from Japan and Korea to Taiwan received incentives from the government at growth stage. Shouldn’t the government provide some support to the private sector, as it is still not very mature?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;It’s true that even high income countries have some form of industrial policy to protect and support the private sector. I would argue that the Nepali private sector is also getting that support through political connections and trade policies that are kind of protectionist. The difference is that East Asian countries had a clear focus on export-led development. So they made sure the support to the private sector was geared towards making the companies very competitive in the international market. In other countries, perhaps in Nepal as well, support being provided to the private sector is not making companies competitive in the international market. That support is instead making them lazy and comfortable and helping them seek rents. I think the focus should be on taking away impediments for new companies, as older companies have already received government’s support.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, you think rent-seeking is one of the biggest problems here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;It is the biggest problem. There is a positive correlation between exports and growth because you learn a lot and get competitive pressure when a country gets integrated in the international market. We have found that it is even better to export to countries that are very integrated in the international market. Recently, we published a report that established the link between exports and quality of jobs in South Asia. The findings make it very clear that rent-seeking, being comfortable and not having enough to export are the problems that are preventing productivity growth in South Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;Bruce Springsteen&amp;#8217;s new studio release breaks fresh ground for the veteran rocker, who turns his back not only on the blistering sound of the E Street Band but also abandons the haunting acoustic moods pioneered on &amp;#8220;Nebraska&amp;#8221; and fine-tuned on later solo efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;After the soul-searching, confessional tone of his best-selling autobiography and sold-out Broadway show, Springsteen&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Western Stars&amp;#8221; relies on an unfamiliar orchestral approach that somewhat masks the singer and is devoid of driving beats, sax solos and rock &amp;#8216;n&amp;#8217; roll tropes.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Instead, he draws on the rich tradition of California-styled, pre-Beatles pop. There are hints of Roy Orbison&amp;#8217;s soaring vocals and Brian Wilson&amp;#8217;s pocket symphonies, but the lyrics are pure Springsteen. Beneath the glossy sheen are the taut narratives, introspection and ambiguous moments familiar to longtime listeners. His storytelling skills are as strong as ever, just presented in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;s paying homage to an era when the single reigned, and radio airtime went a long way to determining an artist&amp;#8217;s success or oblivion, but Springsteen is not looking for No 1 hits with easy hooks. &amp;#8220;Western Stars&amp;#8221; is understated, without over-the-top orchestration or hyperbole. Each song stands alone as a self-contained story; taken as a whole it&amp;#8217;s a panorama of loneliness and heartbreak. The protagonists are mostly men, and mostly beaten down, but there are occasional whiffs of freedom, usually tied to the joys of the open road, that most enduring of American myths.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;It is no accident that the album opens with &amp;#8220;Hitch Hikin'&amp;#8221; and this straightforward image of a loner in perpetual motion: &amp;#8220;Thumb stuck out as I go/I&amp;#8217;m just travelin&amp;#8217; up the road/Maps don&amp;#8217;t do much for me, friend/I follow the weather and the wind.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s a recurring image dating back to the days of Woody Guthrie.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;There are other fully-formed characters from Springsteen&amp;#8217;s imagination: the failed country music songwriter, his lyrics rejected at every turn, the busted up B-movie stuntman held together by rods and pins, even a rundown hotel with an empty swimming pool with dandelions pushing up through the cracked concrete takes on a life of its own as a character in &amp;#8220;Moonlight Motel.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s not all heartbreak. There are small celebrations, too, notably in &amp;#8220;Sleepy Joe&amp;#8217;s Café,&amp;#8221; where working men and women can find solace on the dance floor when weekend comes. It&amp;#8217;s a dreamy place where Monday morning is far, far away, and Springsteen has placed it in the context of the postwar economic boom that powered America for decades: &amp;#8220;Joe came home in &amp;#8217;45 and took out a GI loan/On a sleepy little spot an Army cook could call his own/He married May, the highway come in and they woke up to find they were sitting on top of a pretty little gold mine.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a nostalgic vision, yes, but those roadhouses still exist. You just have to drive a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;Acting Prime Minister and Defence Minister Ishwor Pokharel today said the government could not interfere in matters of the Public Service Commission — a constitutional body — in its act of recruiting employees for local levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;When asked about the Parliamentary State Affairs and Good Governance Committee’s directive to scrap the Public Service Commission’s hiring process, Minister Pokhrel held that the government could not intervene in matters under the jurisdiction of the constitutional body.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Talking to mediapersons at Biratnagar airport, Pokhrel reiterated that the government could not and should not interfere with the PSC’s work, which is abided by the law of the land. “It is absurd to interfere with the PSC when it has already forwarded the process of appointing employees for local levels constitutionally,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Pokhrel argued that the PSC’s move of opening vacancies for hiring employees for local levels was logical as it would take a long time to set up the PSC at the provincial level. He reasoned that the PSC’s decision was constitutional. “PSC will appoint employees at the local levels on the basis of proportional and inclusive theory,” he noted. He clarified that the central office of the PSC would appoint employees for local levels until PSC offices were established at the provincial level.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;On the Media Council Bill tabled in the Parliament by the government, Pokhrel said discussions would be held on the bill and important suggestions would be incorporated in the bill. “The bill does not have any point that restricts the media. It is useless to talk about gagging the media in democracy. But, media should be regulated and systematised,” Pokhrel said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Pokhrel made it clear that his party had not held discussion on the issue of two party co-chairs KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal becoming prime minister by turns. “The two leaders might have made a gentlemen’s agreement. But everything has a process and limitation,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;A panel of 11 judges from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals agreed Monday to hear Led Zeppelin&amp;#8217;s appeal in a copyright lawsuit alleging the group stole its 1971 rock epic from an obscure 1960s instrumental.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;In a 2016 trial that included testimony from Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page and singer Robert Plant, a jury found that &amp;#8220;Stairway to Heaven&amp;#8221; did not significantly resemble the song &amp;#8220;Taurus,&amp;#8221; written by the late Randy Wolfe and performed by his band Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Page said he wrote the music for the song and Plant the lyrics, and that both were original.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;But in September, a three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit ruled that the judge at the trial had failed to advise the jury properly, and ordered a new trial . The judges unanimously found that the trial judge was wrong to tell jurors that individual elements of a song such as its notes or scale may not qualify for copyright protection, because a combination of those elements may qualify if they are sufficiently original.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Led Zeppelin&amp;#8217;s lawyers moved to the next level of appeal, asking for the larger group of judges to rehear the case, and the request was granted. The 11-judge panel will hear the case in late September in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;Trekking Guide Association of Nepal (TGAN) is preparing to launch protest programmes after the government failed to address their demands of removing tax collection at national parks and not giving permission to individual trekkers.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;TGAN has submitted a memorandum to the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation today.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Prior to this, TGAN had submitted a request letter to the government and tourism-related organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;However, as the association has not heard back from any of the concerned bodies, it has decided to launch protests.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“Our demand with the government was to stop issuing Free Individual Trekker (FIT) permit and to stop collecting guide fee at national parks,” said Sarki Sherpa, general secretary of TGAN. Sherpa claimed that the trekking guides are losing their employment due to FIT.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Thus, TGAN has asked the government to scrap FIT permits and bring a policy of hiring guides compulsorily during treks. Currently, Nepal Tourism Board has been issuing FIT permits while Trekking Agencies’ Association of Nepal issues the Group Trekkers permits.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;TGAN has also objected to national parks collecting fees from guides. The national parks have started collecting Rs 1,500 as guide fee from this spring season from trekking guides. As per Sherpa, national parks are collecting guide fee under the title ‘Nature Guide’. He, however, said that they are already licensed trekking guides working at high altitudes, so they do not have to pay the nature guide fee.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“We agree to pay for wildlife reserves as we don’t have any idea on nature guidance and we have to hire nature guides. But for high altitude trekking, it is unfair to collect charge from trekking guides,” Sherpa said, adding, “However, the government has remained silent on this issue.” He further said that if the government again fails to address their demands, they will launch their protest programmes.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;Trudeau announced the move from the banks of a lake in Gault Nature Reserve in Quebec less than five months before a national election in which climate change and pollution are among the top campaign issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;To be honest, as a dad, it&amp;#8217;s tough trying to explain this to my kids. How do you explain dead whales washing up on beaches around the world, their stomachs jam-packed with plastic bags?&amp;#8221; Trudeau said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As parents we&amp;#8217;re at a point when we take our kids to the beach and we have to search out a patch of sand that isn&amp;#8217;t littered with straws, Styrofoam or bottles. That&amp;#8217;s a problem, one that we have to do something about.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"highlight\" data-qa-component=\"highlight-text\"&gt;Canada&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8216;s move follows one by the European Parliament, which voted earlier this year to ban several single-use plastic products, and recent disputes with the Philippines and Malaysia over Canadian waste shipped to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Less than 10% of plastic used in&lt;span class=\"highlight\" data-qa-component=\"highlight-text\"&gt; Canada &lt;/span&gt;gets recycled, and Canadians will throw away an estimated C$11 billion ($8.3 billion) worth of plastic materials each year by 2030 without a change in course, the government said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"highlight\" data-qa-component=\"highlight-text\"&gt;Canada &lt;/span&gt;has delayed implementation until 2021 to allow time for a &amp;#8220;science-based&amp;#8221; decision on exactly which plastics &amp;#8220;are harmful to the environment and human health,&amp;#8221; according to a government statement.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;It will also give businesses time to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The restaurateurs will take a hit, but some of the extra cost will be passed onto consumers, too,&amp;#8221; said Claudio Fracassi, owner of the Soup Guy Plus restaurant in central Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;He uses Styrofoam soup cups and plastic utensils, but plans to switch to paper products, which cost more, he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I want to save the environment. I recycle. But I want more choices (of non-plastic products) and the emphasis should be put on the manufacturer,&amp;#8221; Fracassi said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"highlight\" data-qa-component=\"highlight-text\"&gt;Canada &lt;/span&gt;may require manufacturers to use a set amount of recycled content, the government said. Also, federal and provincial authorities will work together so that companies, rather than just municipalities, take more responsibility for the recycling process.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Federation of Independent Business called for an assessment of the economic impacts of the ban.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If done hastily, this policy could add a whole lot of new red tape to their plates,&amp;#8221; CFIB President Dan Kelly said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"highlight\" data-qa-component=\"highlight-text\"&gt;Canada &lt;/span&gt;recently became entangled in a political dispute with the Philippines over 1,500 tons of household waste &amp;#8211; mislabeled as recyclable plastics &amp;#8211; shipped to Southeast Asia in 2013 and 2014.&lt;span class=\"highlight\" data-qa-component=\"highlight-text\"&gt; Canada &lt;/span&gt;agreed to take it back last month after a protracted diplomatic spat.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Malaysia similarly said it would return 3,000 tons of plastic waste from&lt;span class=\"highlight\" data-qa-component=\"highlight-text\"&gt; Canada&lt;/span&gt;, the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The issue of plastic pollution will increasingly be seen as an issue for developing countries that feel they are being dumped with waste from rich countries that should be taking care of their own waste internally,&amp;#8221; said Sara Seck, a Dalhousie University law professor.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;A key mystery in the crash is why the Agusta A109E was flying at all in a rainstorm in tightly controlled airspace above midtown Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;To enter that vicinity, de Blasio said, the pilot would have needed approval from the air traffic control tower at LaGuardia Airport across the East River in Queens, “and we need to find out if that happened.”&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement “FAA air traffic controllers did not handle” the helicopter’s flight, but a spokeswoman for the agency declined to say whether the aircraft was observing prevailing flight restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;“Tim McCormack is a well-respected, highly trained veteran pilot who also had tremendous local knowledge, having flown in this area for many years,” Dudley said in a phone interview. “We’re all saddened and shocked.”&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;McCormack worked for Daniele Bodini, founder of the real estate firm American Continental Properties Group, Dudley said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The chopper took off from a heliport on Manhattan’s east side at 1:32 pm and crash-landed on the building 11 minutes later, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The site is about half a mile from Trump Tower, where US President Donald Trump maintains an apartment. The area has been under a temporary flight restriction since his election in November 2016.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FELT LIKE HE WAS SHOVED &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Nathan Hutton, who works in information technology for the French bank BNP Paribas on the 29th floor, said the building shook when the helicopter slammed into the roof.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“It felt like you were just standing there, and someone takes their hand and just shoves you,” he said. “You felt it through the whole building.”&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Trump called New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was at the scene soon after the crash, to offer assistance if needed, the governor’s office said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Cuomo said the crash likely stirred memories of September 11 for many city residents.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“If you’re a New Yorker, you have a level of PTSD from 9/11,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;In addition to BNP Paribas, the AXA Equitable Center, built in 1985 houses offices for corporate tenants such as law firms Willkie Farr &amp;amp; Gallagher and Sidley Austin, and investment manager New Mountain Capital. Le Bernardin, one of New York City’s most celebrated restaurants, is also in the building.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The skyscraper is managed by Los Angeles-based CommonWealth Partners. CommonWealth office manager LeAnn Holsapple said the company had “no comment at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Manhattan has only three approved heliports after they were banned in New York City in 1977 after a rotor blade snapped on a helicopter on top of the former Pan Am building, killing five people.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Forest and Environment had conducted the emission test with the support of Department of Transport Management and traffic police as part of a weeklong programme organised to mark World Environment Day.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The test was conducted randomly on 33 private and public vehicles. Of the total vehicles, 25 vehicles failed the test. In comparison to other vehicles, the condition of diesel vehicles was found the worst as only one diesel vehicle of the total 15 such vehicles cleared the test. The DoTM is the only authorised government body for penalising vehicles for failing the emission test. The DoTM has two machines to conduct the emission test inside Kathmandu valley.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The DoTM and the traffic police have been regularly conducting emission tests on vehicles plying the valley’s roads since April 4. The officials said they had been conducting emission tests six days a week, except on Saturdays, with an average of 30 vehicles per day. Director General of DoTM Kumar Prasad Dahal claimed that only 40 per cent of vehicles on average had failed the tests they conducted, earlier.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;During yesterday’s random emission test, majority of petrol vehicles that failed the test had exceeded 10 per cent toxic fumes, while smoke opacity of diesel vehicles had reached 99.99 Hartridge Smoke Unit(HSU).&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Vehicles that failed the emission test were penalised with a fine ranging from Rs 1,000 to 5,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that GBIA has made remarkable progress in recent months, as almost 80 per cent of works has been completed so far. Till June last year, only 43 per cent of works had been completed.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Prabesh Adhikari, project manager of GBIA, is hopeful that construction of physical infrastructure within GBIA will be completed by December if everything progresses as planned and commercial operation of the country’s second international airport will begin from March next year. If this happens, Adhikari will be credited for not only successfully completing GBIA, but also for bringing into operation first national pride project.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Locals are hopeful that once completed, GBIA will change the outlook of not only Bhairahawa but the entire Lumbini region.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;However, the frustration among those who have invested in construction of big hotels around GBIA and Lumbini is rising due to frequent delays in project completion.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INVESTMENTS AT RISK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;As per the investors, the delay has added a huge financial burden on investors and further delays could lead many of them to bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The construction of GBIA started in January 2015 with a target to complete it within December 2017. However, only 27 per cent of physical works had been completed by then.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Hence, Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal — the aviation sector regulator — had extended the project’s construction deadline to June 15, 2018. But till then only 46 per cent of physical works had been finished and CAAN further extended the deadline to June 16 this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Investors are worried that even the third deadline was missed as 20 per cent of physical works is still to be completed and CAAN is preparing to extend the project deadline for the third time, possibly to December.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“There are many investors like me who have injected billions in star hotels and while some of these facilities are ready to serve tourists, majority of them are nearing completion.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;However, the occupancy rate has been dismal and hoteliers are under immense financial burden,” said Pawan Halway, managing director of Pawan Group of Hotels.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Along with the delayed operation of GBIA, banks’ interest rates have been perennially rising and this has troubled the investors. They mentioned that initially the banks provided loans at eight per cent interest which has ballooned to over 12 per cent at present.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“If the situation does not improve and operation of GBIA is delayed by another year then a majority of hoteliers here will be bankrupt,” said Sanjay Bajimaya, first vice-president of Nepal Association of Tours and Travel Agents.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Project Manager Adhikari accepts that delayed operation of the airport has troubled investors and their concerns are genuine. However, he believes that construction of any large project is not an overnight process and investors should have formulated a proper business plan to cope with such situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“Though project works were affected initially, things have progressed smoothly in recent days,” informed Adhikari. “Effective coordination among related government agencies and timely decisions on various aspects related to the project will ensure that at least all physical infrastructure of GBIA will be completed within this December and the airport will start operation from March next year.”&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000080\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOPE LIVES ON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;As of today, all works related to construction of 3,000-metre runway pavement, pavement of linking taxiway, structural work of arrival and departure lounges, administrative building, pavement of international apron area, structural work of control tower building (except last floor) and pavement of CFR apron, among others have been completed.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;As per Adhikari, remaining works include installation of different aviation related equipment and technology and finishing works of terminal buildings, among others.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Chinese contractor Northwest Civil Aviation Airport Construction Company has been developing the $70 million project. Of the total project cost, Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been offering 40.5 per cent as loan and 10 per cent as grant. Similarly, OPEC Fund for International Development is assisting 30.5 per cent of the project cost while CAAN is injecting 11 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, ADB Country Director Mukhtor Khamudkhanov expressed his happiness with the project in the recent months and expects that completion of GBIA would boost tourism and entire economy in the region.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;The National Tuberculosis Programme, as per its strategic plan for 2016-21, had set a target of 95 per cent reduction in the occurrence of tuberculosis and reduction in death rate by 90 per cent by 2035. The number of TB deaths was recorded at around 5,000 in 2015, according to National Tuberculosis Centre.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;As many as 18 deaths are attributed to TB each day. A total of 123 new tuberculosis cases are reported on a daily basis. Some 34 cases of TB are not reported to hospitals. It is estimated that 44,000 new infections occur annually, while TB accounts for 5,000 to 7,000 deaths in a year across the country, according to NTC&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a programme organised by Joint External Monitoring Mission of Nepal National Tuberculosis Programme here today, Paul Nunn, the team leader of JEMM, said that it was difficult to bring down the number of tuberculosis patients to zero by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;JEMM is clear that Nepal is not on the path to achieving the target. Preliminary results of the ongoing prevalence survey suggest that the burden of TB is greater than it was estimated.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;A team of national and international experts led by Nunn had carried out a survey in provinces 2, 3, 5, Karnali Province and Far-west Province this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The survey has shown that the National Strategic Plan 2016-2021 has been not been implemented effectively due to lack of staffers and fund. The survey team said the programme became ineffective with the implementation of the federal structure.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;According to the survey, some of the reasons for the ineffectiveness of the plan are outdated TB diagnosis process, lack of containers to transport lab samples securely and safely, and poor condition of GeneXpert machines.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“Due to poor financial condition and lack of hospitals in remote areas, many people in the country are still deprived of treatment,” said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health and Population Upendra Yadav.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;TB is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. Ending the TB epidemic by 2030 is among the health targets of the sustainable development goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;Among them, 28 are located in the Kathmandu Valley and the remaining are based in other districts.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The supply of Nepali workers to Malaysia has been halted since May last year after the government cracked down on Immigration Security Clearance and One Stop Centre that had been levying additional charges on Nepali migrants for obtaining the health certificates.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kathmandu, June 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Finance has allowed airline companies to import spare parts at one per cent customs tax like in the previous days. Prior to this, on June 3, the Airlines Operators’ Association of Nepal (AOAN) had issued a press statement stating that air services may be interrupted due to lack of spare parts as the customs office refused to release the spare parts at one per cent customs tax.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;As per the new Finance Act, one per cent customs tax will be levied on propellers, rotor blades, wheel brakes, steering, landing gears, window-sills and engines. All the other spare parts will invite 30 per cent customs tax, as per the act. Previously, all spare parts were allowed to be imported at one per cent tax.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Following the new act, the customs office had not released those spare parts for which 30 per cent tax was to be levied. However, the Finance Ministry has stated that all spare parts can be imported at one per cent customs tax.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the confusion regarding the customs tax was created due to the 55th annual report of the Office of the Auditor General (OAG). The report had mentioned that airline companies were not paying customs tax on spare parts besides the aforementioned ones. The ones not mentioned in the list are referred to as ‘other spare parts’. After the OAG report was made public, the customs office had halted the release of ‘other spare parts’.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“The confusion over customs tax on ‘other spare parts’ has now been cleared by the Finance Ministry. With this, the airline operators can now import other spare parts also by paying one per cent customs tax same as before,” said Pabitra Karki, president of AOAN.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Earlier, AOAN had sought support from concerned authorities on the issue. After the concerned authorities did not respond to the association’s request, it had published a press statement stating that air services could be interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“We had requested the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, Ministry of Finance, OAG, Department of Customs and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal to resolve the issue but they only assured us verbally of doing the needful,” he said, adding, “That is why we issued a press statement informing them that air services could be interrupted.”&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the new Financial Act has also waived 13 per cent value added tax (VAT) on import of spare parts. Prior to this, the airline companies had been paying one per cent customs tax along with 13 per cent VAT on import of spare parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Airline operators had been seeking VAT waiver on import of spare parts for a long time citing that it was necessary to make the domestic airline sector stronger and competitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;As per the act, VAT on spare parts of helicopters weighing between 2,000 kg to 15,000 kg has been removed. Similarly, VAT has been removed for spare parts of aircraft weighing more than 15,000 kg.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;Khand told the House that protesters had demonstrated peacefully against some provisions of the Guthi Bill yesterday, but the police unjustifiably used force against them. “If this Guthi Bill is enacted into law, it will destroy the sanatan (eternal) traditions in Nepal,” Khand said and added that the government that sprinkled holy wine and wore caps of the universities involved in religious conversion, was now trying to spoil sanatan religion in the country.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Khand used the holy wine reference to remind the public that the government had provided platform in Kathmandu to South Korea-based Universal Peace Federation, which was accused of promoting Christianity in the garb of peace and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Minister of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Padma Aryal responded to the NC chief whip’s concerns, saying the bill incorporated new provisions to address&lt;em&gt; guthi&lt;/em&gt; related issues in a changed context. She, however, said that the bill did not violate any constitutional provision.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Whip of Nepali Congress in the HoR Pushpa Bhusal said that&lt;em&gt; guthi&lt;/em&gt; system had been in existence since Licchhavi era and the government should have brought the bill only after consulting&lt;em&gt; guthi&lt;/em&gt; operators.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;After Bhusal finished her speech, Speaker Mahara repeatedly asked NC lawmakers to be seated but NC lawmakers continued to obstruct House proceedings, forcing the speaker to postpone the House meeting till 11:00am tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Government sources said Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa failed to respond to NC lawmakers in the HoR today due to his busy schedule. The HoR was supposed to discuss ministry-wise allocation of budget today.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a meeting of the National Assembly was postponed twice in the morning today due to House obstruction by NC lawmakers. Chairperson of NA Ganesh Prasad Timilsina convened the meeting of the House at around 4:00pm today and in this meeting NC lawmakers ended their obstruction after Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa gave a statement of urgent public importance on use of force against protesters at Maitighar Mandala.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Thapa said police went by the book yesterday to use force against protesters at Maitighar Mandala as protesters obstructed movement of people and vehicles at Maitighar Mandala and started pelting stones at police.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“Police had no option but to use force against unruly protesters who threw stones at the police and vehicles,” Thapa said and added that protesters did not abide by the principles of peaceful protest.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Thapa said he was sad that some police personnel and protesters were injured yesterday during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;He also said that Kathmandu police were investigating yesterday’s incident and the government was ready to take action against those found guilty of any wrongdoing. The NA continued its debate on ministry-wise allocation of budget.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;Starting next fiscal which begins on July 17, the government is introducing a biometric system for already listed as well as new value added tax (VAT) consumers, for transparency in the taxation system.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada, while announcing the federal budget for next fiscal, had said that VAT enrollers would have to compulsorily get registered at the biometric system of the concerned tax office.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“The biometric system will ensure that a single person or a company is unable to have multiple VAT accounts,” said a high-ranking official at the Ministry of Finance (MoF).&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;This means that from next fiscal year, VAT enrollers must update all information, including finger prints, retina scans, company details, at the biometric system.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Moreover, officials claim they will be able to gauge the capacity of the VAT enroller based on the documents they provide, meaning suspicious cases could be put in the ‘watchlist’.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;According to the ministry, new VAT enrollers will have to be registered in the biometric system from next fiscal, while the old enrollers will be given a year to get themselves registered.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“Some business houses have been practising unethical business by getting VAT accounts under their workers’ name. They import a large consignment using that account and then close the account within a few months,” the MoF official said, adding that such fraudulent practices came to light only after a number of such cases were filed in the court.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;As per the official, the new requirement will ensure that such cases are completely eliminated, as only genuine businesspersons will be able to get the VAT accounts.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Earlier, the finance ministry had directed the Inland Revenue Department to develop an integrated framework for the new system.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;As per MoF, the new system will be integrated with the Permanent Account Number as well. The ministry plans to interlink the biometric system with all banks and financial institutions authorised to provide VAT transaction and Employment Provident Fund, among others, to maintain transparency in tax.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The MoF official said that the ministry has allocated necessary budget for installation of biometric system in all tax offices across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“We have started to do the homework for acquiring goods and necessary materials for the purpose,” he informed.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;The statement on state news agency KCNA, echoing a similar warning last week, reflected the stalemate since a second summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi in February collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The Hanoi summit broke down over US demands for North Korea’s denuclearization and North Korean demands for sanctions relief.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;The report said a four-point joint statement signed by Trump and Kim on June 12 last year pledging to work towards a new relationship “is in danger of being a blank sheet of paper because the US is turning a blind eye to its implementation”.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“ &amp;#8230; now is the time for the US to withdraw its hostile policy concerning the DPRK,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;The recommendation committee led by former chief justice of the Supreme Court Om Prakash Mishra today failed to convene its meeting as political parties failed to reach consensus on seat sharing in the two transitional justice mechanisms — Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The two commissions have remained vacant ever since their members retired on April 13.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The recommendation committee, formed on March 25, was supposed to prepare a list of probable candidates for the posts of chairpersons and members of TRC and CIEDP in today’s meeting from among the 57 applications it collected. But the meeting failed to convene after its Chair Mishra had to leave for India on ‘urgent work’, said the committee’s Spokesperson Sharmila Karki.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;However, sources with knowledge of the developments said the meeting was deferred as short-listing of candidates would be fruitless without political consensus.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The major problem, according to sources, is that the parties — The Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and Nepali Congress — are sticking to their guns on the sharing of posts of chairpersons of the two commissions.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;While the NC wants appointment of its nominee to the post of TRC chairperson, the NCP is in no mood to concede. The NCP is okay with the NC taking the chairmanship of CIEDP. The NCP and the NC, however, have tentatively agreed on sharing seats on 60:40 basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, after the parties forward names of their nominees, the number of applicants will increase,” the source said, adding that it was unlikely that chairpersons of the commissions would be appointed from among the 57 applicants.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;As per the selection process, the committee can list any eligible person’s name, even if that person has not filed application within the deadline, on the recommendation of a person or institution or at the committee’s own discretion, considering the special qualification and experience of that person.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The parties had previously agreed to finalise the appointments before Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli left for his Europe trip on June 8. Top leaders, including PM Oli, NCP Co-chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba held meetings on June 5 and 6 to finalise the issue, but failed to reach consensus.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The committee’s member Prakash Osti, however, denied any political intervention and said the selection process was taking time as they wanted to ensure appointment of competent chairpersons and members who could effectively lead the commissions. “We are doing homework honestly,” he said. Another pertinent issue in the transitional justice process is amendment to the Enforced Disappearances Inquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act &amp;#8211; 2014.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;Victims of the decade-long armed conflict have for long demanded that the act be amended in line with the Supreme Court verdict, as one of the major reasons for failure of the commissions to make significant progress in investigation is lack of necessary legislation. So they are of the view that the processes of act amendment and appointment of TRC, CIEDP members should be taken ahead simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The SC, in its verdicts on different occasions, ruled that there should not be amnesty for grave human rights violations such as extrajudicial killing, enforced disappearance, torture, rape and other acts of sexual violence; the statute of limitations for grave offences must be removed; cases recommended by the TRC and the CIEDP must be prosecuted; torture and enforced disappearance must be criminalised through enactment of laws; cases before the court cannot be transferred to the TRC or the CIEDP; dignified and respectable reparation for victims; and no reconciliation without the consent of victims.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;“A review has to be done on why the commissions failed so far and work to address the shortcomings by amending the act. Just appointing five members each in the commissions will not yield the desired results,” said Suman Adhikari, former chairperson of Conflict Victims Common Platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;However, sources said the parties were positive on amending the act. They reached tentative understanding at the meetings of June 5 and 6 to immediately begin the process of act amendment once consensus is reached on the names of the chairpersons of the commissions.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

       "&lt;p&gt;Initial voices of murmur against the Guthi Bill have now spilled over into the streets, with protesters ready for a showdown with the government should it refuse to withdraw the bill that has been tabled in the Parliament. On Monday, riot police resorted to the use of batons and water cannons to disperse protesters at the Maitighar Mandala, injuring about a dozen demonstrators. With the announcement of more protests, including a Valley shut down, until the government withdraws the bill, things could turn pretty nasty in the days ahead. What prompted the government to table the bill, which strives to bring all guthis under a Guthi Authority, in the National Assembly is hard to say, but it has kicked up a storm, with the people, especially the Newar community of Kathmandu, demanding a revision or total withdrawal. The people especially smell a rat in the provision that allows the Authority to acquire, use and sell both movable and immovable guthi property. The Guthi Sansthan, the state-owned umbrella guthi organisation, owns about 1.45 million ropanis of public guthi land across the country, and it generates revenue by leasing out land to individuals and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;A guthi is a social organisation, or a trust, that manages the cultural, social and religious activities through the income of its land holdings. It is a unique identity of the country that has withstood the test of time spanning not decades but centuries. For hundreds of years, the guthis have been carrying out daily worship and rituals at the temples without a break, besides managing their upkeep and associated festivals. A guthi is also a philanthropic body helping to maintain public shelters, stone water spouts and irrigation canals, to name a few, while carrying out different services to humanity. People fear the Guthi Authority will wipe out the cultural and religious heritage as it will become no more than a recruitment ground for party cadres who have little or no attachment to the local culture. Also when no government entity has functioned well, how do you expect the Authority to do any better?&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The bill would not have generated controversy had the government consulted the stakeholders at the time of drafting it. Instead it seems intent on bulldozing it through the Parliament on the strength of its two-thirds majority. It might have brought the bill with good intentions, in the wake of dwindling income from guthi land and growing expenses incurred in carrying out rituals and festivals. But the chances of destroying the guthi system are higher than actually strengthening it. And when you destroy the very cultural and religious institutions that fund your traditions, culture, religion and jatras, it becomes easy for outsiders to impose their religion and values. In view of the people’s sentiments, it is best the government drop the bill. Instead, it could begin a study on the status of guthis across the country and then sit down with the stakeholders to see how they could be modernised and better managed in the changing social, political and economic context. The guthi is part of our cultural diversity. We can’t let it die on a government whim.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;hr /&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labour pacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The government is all set to reach labour pacts with Mauritius and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in Geneva this week, during the 100th anniversary celebrations of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The ILO has played a crucial role in ensuring the rights of migrant workers all over the world. While Nepal is going to sign a labour pact with Mauritius for the first time, the new accord with the UAE will replace the old one signed in 2007. The new accord with the UAE will ensure that Nepali migrant workers receive equal treatment in terms of pay and facilities provided to migrant workers from other countries. A labour pact with Mauritius will also be in line with the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
       "&lt;p&gt;The Nepal government has already reached labour pacts with several countries, including Japan, Korea, Malaysia and other Gulf countries, with a view to safeguarding the ILO-defined rights of Nepali migrant workers. While it is commendable to reach such agreements with the labour receiving countries, the government should also create an enabling condition within the country to absorb as much of the youth force as possible. The government cannot achieve the goal of a “prosperous Nepal and happy Nepalis” unless it creates enough jobs within the country.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
